# A set of SQL puzzles

Once the `app` database is created in Postgresql, we can use the SQLs in this folder to do the [classical SQL puzzles](https://dev.to/binoy123/sql-puzzles-3mei).

* Prepare employee database: copy paste the content of [prepare_tables.sql](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/db-play/tree/master/postgresql/puzzles/prepare_tables.sql)

* Here is a summary of the puzzles implemented so far, and see the sql for subject and code explanation:
